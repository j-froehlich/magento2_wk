<p>In order to show a larger image, change the "small" in the path of the thumbnail to "large". So, use two folders: one "large" and one "small"; fill them accordingly with images. You can also replace the "#" with another path. In that case, the path to the large image is not being replaced automatically.</p>

        <p>I hear the jury's still out on science. We just call it a sausage. That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.' I'm afraid I just blue myself. Across from where? Get me a vodka rocks.

Well, what do you expect, mother? First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn't date magicians. Oh, you're gonna be in a coma, all right. Michael! Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you'll have more fun. Michael! Army had half a day. Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us down. He didn't like his trailer. Michael! There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. As you may or may not know, Lindsay and I have hit a bit of a rough patch. Really? Did nothing cancel? It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you.
