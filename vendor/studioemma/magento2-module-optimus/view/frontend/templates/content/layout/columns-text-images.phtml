<p>Only you could make those words cute. I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals. I am not a killer. Hello, Dexter Morgan. Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be. I like seafood. Keep your mind limber. I like seafood. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be. Keep your mind limber. Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment. I'm partial to air conditioning. Makes me a ... scientist. Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized. He taught me a code. To survive. Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized. I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You? I'm doing mental jumping jacks. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo. I'm really more an apartment person.</p>

<p>You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me! No. We're on the top. Hello, little man. I will destroy you! Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! I'm Santa Claus! You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! And then the battle's not so bad? Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.</p>
