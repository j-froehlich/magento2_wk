<p>I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go. It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head.</p>

<p>Anyone who laughs is a communist! Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful! Belligerent and numerous. I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there! Daylight and everything. Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards. Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it. And until then, I can never die? Large bet on myself in round one. It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Who are you, my warranty?! Actually, that's still true. OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. File not found. I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him. No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhhâ€¦ also, comes with double prize money. You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! Who am I making this out to? We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny!</p>
